# password-generator
A simple app that can generate random passwords upon clicking the generate random password button

This app was good practice of using the Math.random() function to generate random numbers, hence randomising the array index to generate the passwords. In addition, it was a good opportunity to practice using a basic for loop to generate a set length of passwords.

Functions to implement in the future:

-  To be able to copy the password to the clipboard after clicking the password
-  Hide the password with an optional toggle to see it after clicking on it
-  Add a button pressed effect when generating passwords
